1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
A startup is a type of company, usually in the technology field, that allows mediocre men to feed their egos by exploiting the time, labor, or wealth of other people.

2
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,500
Now, if you're watching this, there's a decent chance you want to create your own startup.

3
00:00:14,500 --> 00:00:21,500
Maybe you're a new grad, long-time software engineer, or a sociopath with an unquenchable desire for power and control.

4
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:31,500
Either way, everyone is welcome here, as long as you don't have a license.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
and have no problem working 18 hours a day, 7 days a week.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,000
First, let's talk about the difference between a startup and a traditional business.

3
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,000
In a traditional business, you provide a good or service to someone in exchange for money.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,000
However, if you're stupid enough to start a company like this,

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,000
you'll only be able to provide a good life for your family and send your kids to college.

6
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,000
If you want to become the supreme ruler of the world,

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:30,000
and satisfy your quench for power by landing on a four-star rating,


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,780
list, there's only one way to do that. With a startup. In a startup, you sell

2
00:00:05,780 --> 00:00:11,780
imaginary goods or services and lose money. Losing money is key because the

3
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:15,420
more money you lose, the hotter your startup and the more funding you'll be

4
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:20,060
able to get. And with that extra funding, you'll be able to extract even more

5
00:00:20,060 --> 00:00:24,620
money from your users, basically providing you with a real-life infinite

6
00:00:24,620 --> 00:00:30,020
money hand.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,000
hack.

2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:04,620
When founding your own startup, you'll first need to decide what your startup is going

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:05,620
to do.

4
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:10,220
Lucky for you, there are numerous fields that are incredibly hot in tech right now.

5
00:00:10,220 --> 00:00:12,060
Have a really big lung capacity?

6
00:00:12,060 --> 00:00:13,060
Try crypto.

7
00:00:13,060 --> 00:00:15,660
Fan of how banks fuck over the little guy?

8
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:16,660
Fintech.

9
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:18,420
Wanna exploit the vulnerable?

10
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:19,420
Healthcare.

11
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:21,700
Wanna exploit the already exploited?

12
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:24,340
Do anything with on-demand in the name.

13
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:25,340
Wanna do evil shit?


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,040
it, AI.

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:05,320
Wanna do evil shit, but you dropped out of college?

3
00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:06,320
Metaverse.

4
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:11,280
Of course, these will all be irrelevant in 3 years, when the new Gidgety Do Biddley Bop

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,520
comes out, so you better get to working.

6
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:18,240
You'll also have to decide if you're going to be an enterprise or consumer company.

7
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,160
Enterprise companies sell their product to other enterprise companies, in a never-ending

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:33,120
cycle of keep-the-rich-people's-money-away-from-poorness.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,200
people. Consumer companies, on the other hand, extract money from the poor people to put into

2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,160
the aforementioned cycle. Now that you've picked your field, it's time to turn your idea into a

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:16,240
reality. A well-known principle in startups is to sell before you build, which basically means

4
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,840
make up some fake shit and get people's money for it. After stealing people's money, I mean,

5
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:30,240
receiving their advance payment for the beta, it's time to get to work.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,380
If you're a technical founder, you can dive right in. If you're not technical,

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:10,600
you're going to need to trick some unsuspecting CS grad into doing the work for you with promises of untold riches and

3
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,240
totally fair stock options. In those early moments, you'll be full of excitement and energy,

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,600
chomping at the bit to do everything you can for your startup.

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Every line of code you write brings a fresh new coat of paint to your vision. Every gig of your life.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,400
hit commit dash a dash m nothing's gonna ever stop me now motherfuckers like a line of cocaine

2
00:00:06,400 --> 00:00:12,200
directly into your hippocampus as you finish integrating the stripe and instagram apis

3
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,680
into your back end you let out an ecstatic cry of joy all that's left is to port your

4
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:24,520
figma design to react what's a few more hours you push your code live to AWS and are finally

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:30,040
able to run.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,760
rest on a grave in the universe.

2
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,440
Three hours later, all of which you've spent trying to figure out why the console keeps

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,240
telling you to go to hell and fuck yourself with an ethernet cable, you'll want to die.

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:13,880
Living the dream, baby.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,400
The key to success when working at a startup is to have negative work-life balance.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,520
Or, as I like to call it, work.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:24,640
Oh, what's that?

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,640
You want to work?


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,080
watch Netflix after work hours? Get that weak shit out of here. You know you could have

2
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,800
spent those hours working, right? Here's what a typical day at a startup looks like.

3
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:15,040
8am sharp, you burst through the door, fill those coffee in hand, and make your way past

4
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,920
the altar of neoliberalism to your desk. From 8 to 9, you check your emails, slack, Jira

5
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:37,960
tickets, and generally just bullshit around pretending to do work while you wake up.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,680
up. From 9 to 9.30, you have your standup with your team, where everyone tries to bullshit

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,840
a reason why they haven't finished the shit they said they would finish last week.

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,640
After standup, you check out the bug that rolled in last night, realize you can't

4
00:00:13,640 --> 00:00:18,520
replicate it, spend 2 hours testing every permutation of every button on your site and

5
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,600
reading the one sentence spell report like it's the da Vinci code, go to the designated

6
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:37,880
frustration conference room and scream into a pillow.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,280
and then come back and give up. At 12 it's time for your 8 minute lunch break.

2
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:10,880
Let's go people that user data isn't going to sell itself. After lunch you

3
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,760
work until 2 on the new feature, being interrupted every 2 minutes by a

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:18,480
support request or to provide feedback on something that doesn't need your

5
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,880
feedback. From 2 to 4 you've got an architecture meeting to plan the next

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,360
set of features. Where a lot of pedantic arguing happens and no one's really


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
No specs actually get written.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:06,880
From 4-7 you get nothing done, but have to pretend to do work, since it's more important

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,920
to be able to say you're working 100 hour weeks than actually be smart about your productivity.

4
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,760
Three months and the end of all communication with family and friends later, you'll finally

5
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:18,440
have a 51% debugged product.

6
00:00:18,440 --> 00:00:24,040
Your DAOs, KPIs, TAMs, PPs, and DsNuts are looking good.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:25,040
You think to yourself, I'm going to get a job.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
We're losing thousands of dollars per week.

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:05,760
Perfect.

3
00:00:05,760 --> 00:00:08,560
We got him exactly where we want him.

4
00:00:08,560 --> 00:00:12,920
Time to go fundraise and take this to the next level.

5
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,680
Fundraising is when you sell your company's stock for money, and is an important part

6
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:18,320
of the startup life cycle.

7
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:25,000
After all, your $6,000 Bay Area rent and $20 sweetgreens aren't going to pay for themselves.

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:28,000
If you want to make a difference, you need to be a good investor.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,060
If you don't have rich parents or can't convince your broke parents to take out a

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:06,720
second mortgage, you've really only got one option.

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:07,720
VCs.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:14,120
VCs are typically known as venture capitalists, but I like to call them VCMs.

5
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:16,120
Vampiric conmen.

6
00:00:16,120 --> 00:00:20,300
The job of a VC is to be a steward of billions of dollars.

7
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:25,520
Not to do stupid shit like build affordable housing or feed the hungry, but to be a good


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,720
to give to psychotic 20 and 30 year olds to build shit on the internet.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,200
For VCs, the appeal is clear.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,400
You're another layer of bullshit away from doing any real work, and you get to reap even

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,880
bigger rewards.

5
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,360
Now, when you hit up the libertarian white guy club to ask for money, you're going to

6
00:00:18,360 --> 00:00:20,200
need a pitch deck.

7
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:37,720
A pitch deck is your way to communicate to the VC why they should invest in your company.


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,440
The key thing to remember when making a pitch deck is to be as delusional as possible.

2
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,680
Just say fuck it and draw an exponential curve for all your graphs and talk about how the

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,720
space you're going to be in is going to grow to a hundred bajillion dollar market by 2030.

4
00:00:14,720 --> 00:00:19,760
In the actual pitch meeting with theses, don't be intimidated by their LaCroix or fancy ass

5
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,760
bathrooms.

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:25,640
In fact, during your pitch, I recommend talking like Donald Trump and making grand jokes about


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,320
Randoyce unverifiable statements to power move those bitches.

2
00:00:04,320 --> 00:00:08,800
All in all, working in a startup isn't as glamorous as it seems.

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,960
In fact, there are much, much, MUCH easier ways to make money.

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,660
But with perseverance, hard work, and lots of single guy privilege, you too can found

5
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:22,680
your own successful startup.

6
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:29,680
After all, when you concentrate wealth in the hands of others, you can't be sure


1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,000
of a vast minority, liberally hand out money to another, reckless, ethically barren minority,

2
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:21,840
and then have no regulations on what they can do, what could go wrong?
